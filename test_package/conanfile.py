"""Package test for sdl-rdp — scaffolded by buildutil, then
project-owned. Consumes the CACHED package exactly as a downstream
consumer would: CMakeDeps generates the find_package config from the
recipe's package_info, the smoke executable compiles against the
shipped headers and links the shipped libraries, and runs.

Extend smoke.cpp with real API calls — the scaffold only proves the
package resolves, compiles, links and executes.
